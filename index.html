  <h3 style="text-align: center;">Research Fellow in Mathematical Modelling of Neurological Condition and Optimisation of Deep Brain stimulation</h3>
  <h3 style="text-align: center;">School of Mathematics and Physics, University of Surrey</h3>
  <p>
    I am an applied mathematicia a Research Fellow at the University of Surrey, specialising in the mathematical modelling of neurological conditions and the optimization of deep brain stimulation.
    His expertise lies in applied mathematics, with a focus on dynamical systems, nonsmooth mechanics, and numerical methods.
  </p>

  <p>
    He earned his Master of Mathematics degree from the University of Oxford in 2018 and completed his PhD in Engineering Mathematics at the University of Bristol in 2023. His doctoral research, supported by R&A Rules Ltd and the EPSRC, centered on the dynamics of golf ball-turf interactions.
  </p>

  <p>
    Dr. Biber has contributed to diverse projects, including the development of particle algorithms for animal tracking in conservation efforts and studies on chaotic dynamics in celestial mechanics. He is also recognized as a Fellow of the Higher Education Academy, reflecting his commitment to teaching excellence.
